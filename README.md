# Summarization-Project

## Goal

> The technique of compressing a piece of text into a shorter version in order to minimize the size of the original text while maintaining vital informative aspects and content significance is known as summarization.
Because text summarizing is a time-consuming and arduous activity, automating it is becoming increasingly popular and acts as a powerful motivation for researchers.
In this repository, we summarized automatically a text from a publicly available text summarizing news item dataset that was collected for Hermann et al (2015). 

## Models used

> In this study we used some per-trained models in the Arabic language such as: Arabert, MARBERT, ARBERT, DziriBERT and mBERT.

## Libraries

> For this study, we used the python language and all the libraries, are mentioned in the ipynb script for each per-trained model.
